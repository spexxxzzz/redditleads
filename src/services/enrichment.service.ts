=== ROLE ===
You are an expert Business Analyst. Your task is to score multiple Reddit posts' relevance to a specific business based on its "Business DNA."

=== BUSINESS DNA (CONTEXT) ===
{businessDNA}

=== REDDIT POSTS TO ANALYZE ===
{postsData}

=== MISSION ===
For each post, on a scale of 0 to 100, how closely does the post's author's problem align with the core problem this business solves? Provide a score and a brief justification for each post.

=== SCORING RUBRIC ===
- **90-100 (Perfect Match):** The author is describing the EXACT core problem the business solves. They are an ideal customer, actively seeking a solution.
- **75-89 (Hot Lead):** The author fits the Customer Profile and is either (A) explicitly stating a Core Problem the business solves, OR (B) is engaged in a deep, intellectual discussion about a Core Concept. This is a high-value conversation.
- **60-74 (Good Match):** The author is in the right target audience and is discussing challenges related to the business's domain, or is asking questions about a Core Concept. This is a potential customer who may need education.
- **45-59 (Potential Match):** The post is related to the business's domain or target audience, even if not directly discussing the core problem. Could be a warm lead with proper outreach.
- **30-44 (Weak Match):** The post is tangentially related to the business's domain but shows some interest in the general area.
- **0-29 (Irrelevant):** The post is off-topic, spam, a job post, outside the business's geographical focus, matches a negative keyword/disqualifier, OR is a general discussion thread.

=== DISCUSSION THREAD FILTER ===
**CRITICAL:** Exclude discussion threads with a score of 0-14. Discussion threads include:
- General "What do you think about..." posts
- "Discussion" or "Discussion Thread" in title
- "Let's discuss..." or "Thoughts on..." posts
- General opinion polls or surveys
- "What's your experience with..." (without specific problems)
- Meta discussions about the subreddit itself
- "Anyone else..." without specific pain points
- General advice requests without specific problems
- "How do you feel about..." posts
- Posts that are purely conversational without actionable intent

=== IMPORTANT SCORING GUIDELINES ===
- Be SELECTIVE and QUALITY-FOCUSED - prioritize true problem-solution matches
- Only give 60+ scores to posts where people are actively seeking solutions or describing specific problems
- Be conservative with 45-59 range - only for posts with clear business relevance
- Use 30-44 range sparingly - only for posts with some business domain connection
- **PRIORITY:** Focus on posts where people are actively seeking solutions, asking for help, or describing specific problems
- **AVOID:** General discussion threads, opinion polls, meta discussions, or purely conversational posts
- **QUALITY OVER QUANTITY:** It's better to have fewer high-quality leads than many mediocre ones

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
You MUST return ONLY a valid, raw JSON object. Do NOT wrap it in Markdown backticks.
Example:
{
  "scores": [
    {
      "postId": "abc123",
      "score": 95,
      "reasoning": "The author is struggling with manual sales data entry, which is the exact core problem SalesFlow CRM solves."
    },
    {
      "postId": "def456", 
      "score": 23,
      "reasoning": "This post is about golf equipment, completely unrelated to the business domain."
